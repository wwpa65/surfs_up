The measurement data table was filtered date informationto retrieve all the temperatures in Hwaii for the months of June and December from data stored inside SQLite database. These data were converted to a list,a DataFrame was created, and the summary statistics were generated.

Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Software used: Jupiter Notebook, VS Code, and SQLite
## Results: 

Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
